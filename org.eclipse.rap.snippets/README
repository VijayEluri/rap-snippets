== RAP Snippet Runner ==

The snippet runner allows to run RAP snippets without registering entrypoints
and restarting the server.

=== Usage ===

* Put your snippets into the package org.eclipse.rap.snippets.
  To keep them separate from this bundle, create a fragment project, e.g.
  org.eclipse.rap.snippets.custom
* Snippet classes must either implement IApplication or IEntrypoint or they must
  have a standard Java main method.
* Snippets can be accessed using a URL like this:
  http://host:port/snippets?class=SnippetName

  If the snippet resides in the package org.eclipse.rap.snippets, you can use
  the unqualified class name, e.g.
    http://localhost:9090/snippets?class=MySnippet

  For other packages, use the fully qualified class name:
    http://localhost:9090/snippets?class=org.eclipse.swt.snippets.Snippet91
